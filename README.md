# RussiaExport

This is the code repository for Russia export patterns analysis. Because github has a limit on the size of uploaded files, the data used for the experiment can be found in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15gbsj1423X4OSC614AAoN8fMC9Syn_S6?usp=sharing (you need to unzip the zip file first before running).

All experiment code is in expermiment.ipynb.
